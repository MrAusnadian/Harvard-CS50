# Harvard-CS50
Harvard CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript – Full University Course

This is a repo to store everything covered in the CS50 course available here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzGllw18DkA

I'll update the repo as I go through it.

I decided to check this out, because HTML, CSS and JavaScript has changed a lot since I last dealt with it directly, so I thought it would be nice to refresh my knowledge.
