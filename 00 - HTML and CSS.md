# HTML 5 and CSS 3

## HTML 5

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` is a document type declaration. This tells the browser that it is HTML 5.
- `<html>` tags are used to represent the begging and end of the HTML content.
  - `lang="en"` within `<html>` helps a search engine know what language the page is written in.
- The `<head>` section is used for information that the browser and search engines will find useful, for example, the page title, meta data, stylesheets, javascript.
- The `<body>` section is used for the information that is displayed to the user in the browser.

Think of the HTML as a document object model (DOM) -- The tree of all the elements of the HTML document.
